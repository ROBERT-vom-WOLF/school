# BFK-7 Project

This Project features all standards given in the [Project-Requirements](projektauftrag.pdf)

## Installation:
Every App needs a config file in a json format. So each App _(Teil1 / Teil2)_ can be configured individually.
There is a example file right next to where the real one should be placed.

Simply head to
**[Teil 1 Config](Teil1/src/resources/config.json.example)** or **[Teil 2 Config](Teil2/src/resources/config.json.example)**, 
duplicate the file and enter your config. Then rename it to **"config.json"** and everything should work.

Make sure that your config-file is in the same folder as the **"config.json.example"** file!

## Usage:
Simply run the **[main.py](Teil1/src/code/python/main.py)** files inside **"src/code/python"** folder.
Make sure that you are in the same folder as the script when you run the script over a bash
